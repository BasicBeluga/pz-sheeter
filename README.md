# Pz Sheeter

Stitches raw texture data into their original sheets.

## How to use this repository:

1. Create a directory called `resources` in the same directory as this `README` file.
2. Unpack texture assets using [this](https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/3511-pz-unpacker/) tool, and place the results in the `resources` directory.
3. Run `main.py` and the results will be output to an `exports` directory next to this `README` file. You now have the latest and greatest tilesheets! If you placed your existing tilesheets in the `resources/existing_sheets` directory, a list of the completely new sheets will be listed. Detecting sheets that have changed is not completed yet.
